# Scikit-Learn-Exploration

This repository is a personal learning space where I‚Äôll be exploring various machine learning concepts using Scikit-learn, one of the most popular ML libraries in Python.

The goal is to build a solid understanding of essential tools and workflows for data analysis and predictive modeling. Each topic will be explored through Jupyter notebooks with code, comments, and visualizations.

## üîç Topics I Hope to Cover
* Data preprocessing and feature engineering
* Supervised learning (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, KNN, SVM)
* Unsupervised learning (e.g., k-means, PCA)
* Model evaluation and validation techniques
* Building pipelines and automating workflows
* Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV)

## üìå Notes
This project is still a work in progress. As I learn and try new techniques, I'll update the notebooks and add new content. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
